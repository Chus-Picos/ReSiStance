Installation instructions
-------------------------

The easiest way to install ReSiStance is to create a Debian
package. There are a couple of ways to do it

   * By typing

     dpkg-buildpackage -rfakeroot -us -uc -sa

   * Alternatively

     make deb

If you prefer to do it by hand or if you're in a non-Debian system
you can use the python distutils way:

python setup.py install
